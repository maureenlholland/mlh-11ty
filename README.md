# Portfolio Site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/)

- YAML Front Matter
- Liquid Templating
- Local build with: `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`

## Static Linting

- Eslint + Prettier

## Testing

- Jest + Puppeteer
- Many thanks to the accessibility experts at [Deque](https://www.deque.com/axe/) for maintaining [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) and keeping it open-source

## Workarounds
`offline.html` creates an offline folder with index.html in the build, so I am ignoring it for TemplateFormats and passing through the root level file
